# Bookmarklets

Here are my bookmarklets, which are simple scripts injected via bookmarks.

## To create a bookmarklet

1. Create a bookmark - click the star in the URL (in chrome)
2. Right click the bookmark
3. Click edit
4. Paste the js code in the URL field

## Format

Make sure the JS you add to the URL field follows the format of the protocol 'javascript:' followed by an IIFE.

For example:
`javascript:(function(){//some code})()`
